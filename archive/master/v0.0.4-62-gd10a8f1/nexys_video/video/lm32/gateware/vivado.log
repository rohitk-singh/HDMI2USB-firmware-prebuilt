INFO: [Synth 8-3354] encoded FSM with state register 'vns_dma_state_reg' using encoding 'sequential' in module 'top'
Block RAM mem_1_reg originally specified as a Byte Wide Write Enable RAM cannot take advantage of ByteWide feature and is implemented with single write enable per RAM due to following reason.
address width (13) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL WARNING: [DRC AVAL-46] v7v8_mmcm_fvco_rule1: The current computed target frequency, FVCO, is out of range for cell MMCME2_ADV. The computed FVCO is 1485.000 MHz. The valid FVCO range for speed grade -1 is 600MHz to 1200MHz. The cell attribute values used to compute FVCO are CLKFBOUT_MULT_F = 10.000, CLKIN1_PERIOD = 6.73401, and DIVCLK_DIVIDE = 1 (FVCO = 1000 * CLKFBOUT_MULT_F/(CLKIN1_PERIOD * DIVCLK_DIVIDE)).
This violation may be corrected by:
  1. The timer uses timing constraints for clock period or clock frequency that affect CLKIN1 to set cell attribute CLKIN1_PERIOD, over-riding any previous value. This may already be in place and, if so this violation will be resolved once Timing is run.  Otherwise, consider modifying timing constraints to adjust the CLKIN1_PERIOD and bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  2. In the absence of timing constraints that affect CLKIN1, consider modifying the cell CLKIN1_PERIOD to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  3. If CLKIN1_PERIOD is satisfactory, modify the CLKFBOUT_MULT_F or DIVCLK_DIVIDE cell attributes to bring FVCO into the allowed range.
  4. The MMCM configuration may be dynamically modified by use of DRP which is recognized by an ACTIVE signal on DCLK pin.

WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP lm32_cpu/multiplier/product0__0 output lm32_cpu/multiplier/product0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-33] MMCM_adv_ClkFrequency_div_dclk: The computed value 1485.000 MHz (CLKIN1_PERIOD, net soc_clk_input) for the VCO operating frequency of the MMCME2_ADV site MMCME2_ADV_X1Y2 (cell MMCME2_ADV) falls outside the operating range of the MMCM VCO frequency for this device (600.000 - 1200.000 MHz).

Please adjust either the input period CLKINx_PERIOD (6.734007), multiplication factor CLKFBOUT_MULT_F (10.000000) or the division factor DIVCLK_DIVIDE (1), in order to achieve a VCO frequency within the rated operating range for this device.
Please note that this check is a Warning because the DCLK pin has an ACTIVE signal and it is assumed that dynamic control (DRP) will be exercised to put the VCO frequency into valid operating range.

INFO: [DRC REQP-165] writefirst: Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (lm32_cpu/instruction_unit/icache/memories[0].way_0_tag_ram/mem_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
