WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <eth_clocks_rx> is placed at site <K15>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <BUFGMUX> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X3Y6>. There is only a select
   set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer, and they are
   not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists and correct
   it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was
   applied on COMP.PIN <eth_clocks_rx.PAD> allowing your design to continue.
   This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified
   COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to
   very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be
   corrected in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
