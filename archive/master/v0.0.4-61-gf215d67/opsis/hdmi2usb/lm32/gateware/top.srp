INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 5-bit shift register was found for signal <JpegEnc/U_FDCT/U_MDCT/U_DCT2D/odv_d4_BRB0> and currently occupies 5 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
